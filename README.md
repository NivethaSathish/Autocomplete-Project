# Autocomplete-Project

C program that reads in a list of words (sorted by lexicographic order) along with their importance weights and retrieves the top terms that match a string query. For example, the query "Eng" matches "English", "Engineerin", etc. The program can return all matches ordered by weight (most to least important), return the index of the first term in lexicographic ordering that matches the query, or return the index of the last term in lexicographic ordering that matches the query. This is a class project.
